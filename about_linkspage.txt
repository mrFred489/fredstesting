01/01/2014<br><br>The links page is my first html project, i started working on it in november 2012, and have been working on and off on it since. <br /> It started as a local website which i used as my brwser frontpage, but when i bought this domain the 20. December 2013, i moved it here.<br />It contains my most used links, or links that i would like to remember. Some of the links are not useful for anyone else than me, because they have to do with my school, but it is good as inspiration.
